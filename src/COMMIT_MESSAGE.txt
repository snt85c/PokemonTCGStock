add conversion value

the profile page now gets the conversion value from a free-api nad generates a dropdown list from only certain values (for now just usd, eur, aud, it can be expanded by adding more values to the array otherwise there are too many)

the value and symbol is then saved into the useProfileStore (new name fro UserStore, to keep the similarity in names with other stores), which are then passed down to the cards and the total value
