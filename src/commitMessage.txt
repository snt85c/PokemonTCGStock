add router-dom, useDeckStore, useCollectionStore, save cards on Cloud Firebase

add react-router and different routes. added Menu with routes selection. Cards visualization is improved by having minimal information on screen. the card has a button that when pressed will save the card on the collection screen as well as firebase. modifies the data from the API to add "quantity:number" so that i can keep track of how many cards are in my possession

Search implements zustand store now, all but one state are refactored (searchTrigger is left as State, since its a local state and i dont need it.)

collection is now implemented, gets all the cards from firebase, otherwise shows what we got.
